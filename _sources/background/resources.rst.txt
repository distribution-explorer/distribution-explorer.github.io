===============

The Distribution Explorer is meant to be an easy-to-explore catalog of some of the most widely used probability distributions. Other similar resources exist.

- `Wikipedia's list of distributions <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_probability_distributions>`_
- Michael Betancourt's `Probabilistic Building Blocks <https://betanalpha.github.io/assets/case_studies/probability_densities.html>`_ is similar to this app, but goes into more depth of the probability theory.
- `Adam Cunningham <http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~adamcunn/>`_'s excellent `Probability Playground <https://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~adamcunn/probability/probability.html>`_ is similar to this resource.
- `Ben Lambert <https://ben-lambert.com/bayesian/>`_'s and `Fergus Cooper <https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/fergus.cooper/site/>`_'s `Distribution Zoo <https://ben18785.shinyapps.io/distribution-zoo/>`_ is also quite similar to this resource.
- Chapter 3 of `Seeing Theory <https://seeing-theory.brown.edu/probability-distributions/index.html#section2>`_ allows for interactive exploration of distributions using some pretty slick `D3 <https://d3js.org>`_ visualizations.
- The `Distributome <http://www.distributome.org>`_ also allows for interactive exploration of distributions.
- Chapter 23 of `David MacKay's book <http://www.inference.org.uk/mackay/itila/>`_ is also a useful reference for probability distributions.

Most books in probability and statistics have an appendix with a convenient list or table of probability distributions. The one in the appendix of `Gelman, et al.'s Bayesian Data Analysis <http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/>`_ is quite good.

Finally, Joe Blitzstein's teaching on connecting distributions to stories is excellent. You can check out `his book with Jessica Hwang <http://probabilitybook.net/>`_ and his famous `Stat 110 course <https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110>`_.
